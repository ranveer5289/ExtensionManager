ExtensionManager
================

Enable &amp; Disable extensions.

I find it tedious to open **chrome://extensions/**  and then enable or disable a particular extension. So, to ease up this process I created this extension.

It provides a very basic layout to change the state of the extension.

**TODO** : Improve UI of the extension.
